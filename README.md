# TopPop
### Description
Top Pop is a simple app which connects to Deezer API and presents you top 10 tracks on the Chart with some fancy colors. If you want, you can also sort tracks ascending or descending by their duration.  
And don't worry, you can always sort them back and check who's rocking on the Chart! ;)
